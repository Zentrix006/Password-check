## 🔍 Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use **at least 12–16 characters**.
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols**.
- Avoid **dictionary words or keyboard patterns**.
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `CorrectHorseBatteryStaple!`).
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Use a **password manager** to store complex passwords.

---

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Trying every possible combo (slow but effective for short/weak passwords).
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses precompiled lists of common passwords/phrases.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Reusing breached passwords on other sites.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- Password **length + complexity** > complexity alone.
- Avoid reusing passwords across sites.
- Password managers are your friend.
- MFA adds a critical second layer of defense.
